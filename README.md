## GM Instructions
You can download the latest selection of lcp files from this github repo's [releases page](https://github.com/hiddenkrypt/inGoldenFlameLCP/releases). 

The **In Golden Flame: Act 1 Complete** release contains everything for this campaign which has been made into an item so far, and is what a GM should use.

As the complete lcp contains spoilers for the campaign, you may with to limit your players access to these items. The **In Golden Flame: Act 1 - Mission 1** release is suitable for players creating new characters at the start of the campaign. All further exotic gear upgrades available throughout the campaign will be made available as individual lcps in the **In Golden Flame: Individual Items** release, so you as the GM may give the players those files when they acquire those items. 

## Build Instructions
If you've copied the repo entirely, just run `./buildReleases.sh` to generate lcp files from the source materials. If you've added any files to the source files, you will need to edit buildReleases.sh to include them in generated lcps. This script runs in bash and assumes you have the zip utility installed. This was developed with ubuntu.
